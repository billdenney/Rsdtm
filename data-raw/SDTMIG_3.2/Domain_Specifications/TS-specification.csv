TSPARMCD,Trial Summary Parameter Short Name,Char,TSPARMCD,Topic,"TSPARMCD (the companion to TSPARM) is limited to 8 characters and does not have special character restrictions. These values should be short for ease of use in programming, but it is not expected that TSPARMCD will need to serve as variable names.
