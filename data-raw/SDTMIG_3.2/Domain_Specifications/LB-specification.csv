It can be used as a column name when converting a dataset from a vertical to a horizontal format. The value in LBTESTCD cannot be longer than 8 characters, nor can it start with a number (e.g.”1TEST”). LBTESTCD cannot contain characters other than letters, numbers, or underscores. Examples:
ALT, LDH.",Req
LBTEST,Lab Test or Examination Name,Char,(LBTEST),Synonym Qualifier,"Verbatim name of the test or examination used to obtain the measurement or finding. Note any test normally performed by a clinical laboratory is considered a lab test. The value in LBTEST cannot be longer than 40
