ARMCD,Planned Arm Code,Char,*,Topic,"ARMCD is limited to 20 characters and does not have special character restrictions. The maximum length of ARMCD is longer than that for other “short” variables to accommodate the kind of values that are likely to be needed for crossover trials. For example, if ARMCD values for a seven-period crossover were constructed using two-character abbreviations for each treatment and separating hyphens, the length of ARMCD
values would be 20.",Req

character restrictions. These values should be short for ease of use in programming, but it is not
