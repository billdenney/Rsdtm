--TPT ,"Planned Time Point
Name",Char ,"Text description of time when a measurement or observation should be taken
as defined in the protocol. This may be represented as an elapsed time relative
to a fixed reference point, such as time of last dose. See --TPTNUM and --
TPTREF."
--TPTNUM ,"Planned Time Point
Number",Num ,Numeric version of planned time point used in sorting.
--ELTM ,"Planned Elapsed
Time from Time
Point Ref",Char ,"Planned Elapsed time in ISO 8601 character format relative to a planned fixed
reference (--TPTREF) such as “Previous Dose” or “Previous Meal”. This
variable is useful where there are repetitive measures. Not a clock time or a
date/time variable, but an interval, represented as ISO duration."
--TPTREF ,"Time Point
Reference",Char ,"Description of the fixed reference point referred to by --ELTM, --TPTNUM,
and --TPT. Examples: PREVIOUS DOSE, PREVIOUS MEAL."
--RFTDTC ,"Date/Time of
Reference Time
Point",Char ,"Date/time for a fixed reference time point defined by --TPTREF in ISO 8601
character format."
--STRF ,"Start Relative to
Reference Period",Char ,"Identifies the start of the observation as being before, during, or after the
sponsor-defined reference period. The sponsor-defined reference period is a
continuous period of time defined by a discrete starting point and a discrete
ending point represented by RFSTDTC and RFENDTC in Demographics.
Note: This variable will be deprecated (phased out) in a future (post SDTM
v1.4) release. The functionality of this variable can be replaced by the use of -
-STRTPT with --STTPT = RFSTDTC."
--ENRF ,"End Relative to
Reference Period",Char ,"Identifies the end of the observation as being before, during or after the
sponsor-defined reference period. The sponsor-defined reference period is a
continuous period of time defined by a discrete starting point and a discrete
ending point represented by RFSTDTC and RFENDTC in Demographics.
Note: This variable will be deprecated (phased out) in a future (post SDTM
v1.4) release. The functionality of this variable can be replaced by the use of -
-ENRTPT with --ENTPT = RFENDTC."
--EVLINT ,Evaluation Interval ,Char ,"Duration of interval associated with an observation such as a finding --
TESTCD, represented in ISO 8601 character format. Example: -P2M to
represent a period of the past 2 months as the evaluation interval for a
question from a questionnaire such as SF-36."
--EVINTX ,"Evaluation Interval
Text",Char ,"Evaluation interval associated with an observation, where the interval is not
able to be represented in ISO 8601 format. Examples: LIFETIME, LAST
NIGHT, RECENTLY, OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS."
--STRTPT ,"Start Relative to
Reference Time
Point",Char ,"Identifies the start of the observation as being before or after the sponsor
defined reference time point defined by variable --STTPT."

Time Point",Char ,"Description or date/time in ISO 8601 or other character format of the sponsor
defined reference point referred to by --STRTPT. Examples: ""2003-12-15"" or
""VISIT 1""."
--ENRTPT ,"End Relative to
Reference Time
Point",Char ,"Identifies the end of the observation as being before or after the sponsor
defined reference time point defined by variable --ENTPT."
--ENTPT ,"End Reference Time
Point",Char ,"Description or date/time in ISO 8601 or other character format of the sponsor
defined reference point referred to by --ENRTPT. Examples: ""2003-12-25"" or
""VISIT 2""."
