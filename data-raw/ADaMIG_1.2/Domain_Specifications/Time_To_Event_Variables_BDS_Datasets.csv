STARTDT,Time-to- Event Origin Date for Subject,Num,,,Perm,,"The original date of risk for the time-to-event analysis. This is generally the point at which a subject is first at risk for the event of interest evaluation (as defined in the Protocol or SAP). For example, this may be the randomization date or the date of first study therapy exposure.",,
STARTDTM,Time-to- Event Origin Datetime,Num,,,Perm,,"The original datetime of risk for the time-to-event analysis. This is generally the point at which a subject is first at risk for the event of interest evaluation (as defined in the Protocol or SAP). For example, this may be the randomization datetime or the datetime of first study therapy exposure.",,
STARTDTF,Origin Date Imputation Flag,Char,(DATEFL),,Cond,,"The level of imputation of the start date. See Section 3.1.3, Date and Time Imputation Flag Variables.",,
STARTTMF,Origin Time Imputation Flag,Char,(TIMEFL),,Cond,,"The level of imputation of the start time. See Section 3.1.3, Date and Time Imputation Flag Variables.",,
CNSR,Censor,Num,,,Cond,,Defines whether the event was censored for the subject within the parameter (period of observation truncated prior to event being observed). It is strongly recommended to use 0 as an event indicator and positive integers as censoring indicators. It is also recommended that unique positive integers be used to indicate coded descriptions of censoring reasons. CNSR is required for time-to-event parameters.,,
EVNTDESC,Event or Censoring Description,Char,,,Perm,,Description of the event of interest or censoring reason for the subject within the parameter.,,
CNSDTDSC,Censor Date Description,Char,,,Perm,,Describes the circumstance represented by the censoring date if different from the event date that warrants censoring.,,
