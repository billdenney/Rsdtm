STUDYID,Study Identifier,Char,,Req,"DM.STUDYID, ADSL STUDYID, and/or STUDYID
from another ADaM or SDTM dataset appropriate to the analysis."
USUBJID,Unique Subject Identifier,Char,,Req,"DM.USUBJID, ADSL.USUBJID, and/or USUBJID from
another ADaM or SDTM dataset appropriate to the analysis."
SUBJID,Subject Identifier for the Study,Char,,Perm,"DM.SUBJID, ADSL.SUBJID, and/or SUBJID from
another ADaM dataset appropriate to the analysis. SUBJID is required in ADSL, but permissible in other datasets."
SITEID,Study Site Identifier,Char,,Perm,"DM.SITEID, ADSL.SITEID, and/or SITEID from
another ADaM dataset appropriate to the analysis. SITEID is required in ADSL, but permissible in other datasets."
ASEQ,Analysis Sequence Number,Num,,Perm,"Sequence number given to ensure uniqueness of subject records within an ADaM dataset. As long as values are unique within a subject within the dataset, any valid number can be used for ASEQ. ASEQ uniquely indexes records within a subject within an ADaM dataset. ASEQ is useful for traceability when the dataset is used as input to another ADaM dataset. To refer to a record in a predecessor ADaM dataset, set SRCDOM to the name of the predecessor dataset, and set SRCSEQ to the value of ASEQ in the predecessor dataset."
