Variable Name,Variable Label,Type,Codelist/ Controlled Terms,Core,CDISC Notes
TRTSDT,Date of First Exposure to Treatment,Num,,Cond,"Date of first exposure to treatment for a subject in a study. TRTSDT and/or TRTSDTM are required if there is an investigational product. Note that TRTSDT is not required to have the same value as the SDTM DM variable RFXSTDTC. While both of these dates reflect the concept of first exposure, the ADaM date may be derived to support the analysis which may not necessarily
be the very first date in the SDTM EX domain."
TRTSTM,Time of First Exposure to Treatment,Num,,Perm,Time of first exposure to treatment for a subject in a study.
TRTSDTM,Datetime of First Exposure to Treatment,Num,,Cond,Datetime of first exposure to treatment for a subject in a study. TRTSDT and/or TRTSDTM are required if there is an investigational product.
TRTSDTF,Date of First Exposure Imput. Flag,Char,(DATEFL),Cond,"The level of imputation of date of first exposure to treatment. If TRTSDT (or the date part of TRTSDTM) was imputed, TRTSDTF must be populated and is required. See Section 3.1.3, Date마ndTimeImputation FlagVariables."
TRTSTMF,Time of First Exposure Imput. Flag,Char,(TIMEFL),Cond,"The level of imputation of time of first exposure to treatment. If TRTSTM (or the time part of TRTSDTM) was imputed, TRTSTMF must be populated and is required. See Section 3.1.3, Date마ndTimeImputation FlagVariables."
TRTEDT,Date of Last Exposure to Treatment,Num,,Cond,"Date of last exposure to treatment for a subject in a study. TRTEDT and/or TRTEDTM are required if there is an investigational product. Note that TRTEDT is not required to have the same value as the SDTM DM variable RFXENDTC. While both of these dates reflect the concept of last exposure, the ADaM date may be derived to support the analysis which may not necessarily be the very last date in the SDTM EX domain."
TRTETM,Time of Last Exposure to Treatment,Num,,Perm,Time of last exposure to treatment for a subject in a study.
TRTEDTM,Datetime of Last Exposure to Treatment,Num,,Cond,Datetime of last exposure to treatment for a subject in a study. TRTEDT and/or TRTEDTM are required if there is an investigational product.
TRTEDTF,Date of Last Exposure Imput. Flag,Char,(DATEFL),Cond,"The level of imputation of date of last exposure to treatment. If TRTEDT (or the date part of TRTEDTM) was imputed, TRTEDTF must be populated and is required. See Section 3.1.3, Date마ndTimeImputation FlagVariables."
TRTETMF,Time of Last Exposure Imput. Flag,Char,(TIMEFL),Cond,"The level of imputation of time of last exposure to treatment. If TRTETM (or the time part of TRTEDTM) was imputed, TRTETMF must be populated and is required. See Section 3.1.3, Date마ndTimeImputation FlagVariables."
TRxxSDT,Date of First Exposure in Period xx,Num,,Cond,"Date of first exposure to treatment in period xx. TRxxSDT and/or TRxxSDTM are only required in trial designs where multiple treatment periods are defined (i.e., required when there is a TRTxxP other than TRT01P). Examples include crossover designs or designs where multiple periods exist for the same treatment."
TRxxSTM,Time of First Exposure in Period xx,Num,,Cond,"Starting time of exposure to treatment in period xx. TRxxSTM and/or TRxxSDTM are only required in trial designs where starting time is important to the analysis and multiple treatment periods are defined (i.e., required when there is a TRTxxP other than TRT01P)."
TRxxSDTM,Datetime of First Exposure in Period xx,Num,,Cond,"Datetime of first exposure to treatment in period xx. TRxxSDTM is only required in trial designs where multiple treatment periods are defined (i.e., required when there is a TRTxxP other than TRT01P)."
TRxxSDTF,Date 1st Exposure Period xx Imput. Flag,Char,(DATEFL),Cond,"The level of imputation of date of first exposure to treatment in period xx. If TRxxSDT (or the date part of TRxxSDTM) was imputed, TRxxSDTF must be populated and is required. See Section 3.1.3, Date마nd TimeImputationFlagVariables."
TRxxSTMF,Time 1st Exposure Period xx Imput. Flag,Char,(TIMEFL),Cond,"The level of imputation of time of first exposure to treatment in period xx. If TRxxSTM (or the time part of TRxxSDTM) was imputed, TRxxSTMF must be populated and is required. See Section 3.1.3, Date마nd TimeImputationFlagVariables."
TRxxEDT,Date of Last Exposure in Period xx,Num,,Cond,"Date of last exposure to treatment in period xx. TRxxEDT and/or TRxxEDTM are only required in trial designs where multiple treatment periods are defined (i.e., required when there is a TRTxxP other than TRT01P)."
TRxxETM,Time of Last Exposure in Period xx,Num,,Cond,"Ending time of exposure to treatment in period xx. TRxxETM and/or TRxxEDTM are only required in trial designs where ending time is important to the analysis and multiple treatment periods are defined (i.e., required when there is a TRTxxP other than TRT01P)."
TRxxEDTM,Datetime of Last Exposure in Period xx,Num,,Cond,"Datetime of last exposure to treatment in period xx. TRxxEDTM is only required in trial designs where multiple treatment periods are defined (i.e., required when there is a TRTxxP other than TRT01P)."
TRxxEDTF,Date Last Exposure Period xx Imput. Flag,Char,(DATEFL),Cond,"The level of imputation of date of last exposure to treatment in period xx. If TRxxEDT (or the date part of TRxxEDTM) was imputed, TRxxEDTF must be populated and is required. See Section 3.1.3, Date마nd TimeImputationFlagVariables."
TRxxETMF,Time Last Exposure Period xx Imput. Flag,Char,(TIMEFL),Cond,"The level of imputation of time of last exposure to treatment in period xx. If TRxxETM (or the time part of TRxxEDTM) was imputed, TRxxETMF must be populated and is required. See Section 3.1.3, Date마nd TimeImputationFlagVariables."
