TRTP,Planned Treatment,Char,,Cond,"TRTP is a record-level identifier that represents the planned treatment attributed to a record for analysis purposes. TRTP indicates how treatment varies by record within a subject and enables analysis of crossover and other designs. Though there is no requirement that TRTP will correspond to the TRTxxP as defined by the record’s value of APERIOD, if populated, TRTP must match at least one value of the character planned treatment variables in ADSL (e.g., TRTxxP, TRTSEQP, TRxxPGy).
As noted previously, at least one treatment variable is required even in non-randomized trials. This requirement is satisfied by any subject-level or record-level treatment variables (e.g., TRTxxP, TRTP, TRTA). Even if not used for analysis, any ADSL treatment variable may be included in the
BDS dataset."
TRTPN,"Planned Treatment
(N)",Num,,Perm,The numeric code for TRTP. One-to-one mapping within a study to TRTP.
TRTA,Actual Treatment,Char,,Cond,"TRTA is a record-level identifier that represents the actual treatment attributed to a record for analysis purposes. TRTA indicates how treatment varies by record within a subject and enables analysis of crossover and other multi-period designs. Though there is no requirement that TRTA will correspond to the TRTxxA as defined by the record’s value of APERIOD, TRTA must match at least one value of the character actual treatment variables in ADSL (e.g., TRTxxA, TRTSEQA, TRxxAGy).
As noted previously, at least one treatment variable is required. This requirement is satisfied by any subject-level or record-level treatment variables (e.g., TRTxxP, TRTP, TRTA). Even if not
used for analysis, any ADSL treatment variable may be included in the BDS dataset."
TRTAN,"Actual Treatment
(N)",Num,,Perm,The numeric code for TRTA. One-to-one mapping within a study to TRTA.
TRTPGy,Planned Pooled Treatment y,Char,,Perm,"TRTPGy is the planned pooled treatment y attributed to a record for analysis purposes. “y” represents an integer [1-99, not zero-padded] corresponding to a particular pooling scheme. Useful when planned treatments (TRTP) are pooled together for analysis, for example when all doses of Drug A (TRTPG1=All doses of Drug A) are compared to all doses of Drug B (TRTPG1=All doses
of Drug B). Each value of TRTP is pooled within at most one value of TRTPGy."
TRTPGyN,"Planned Pooled
Treatment y (N)",Num,,Perm,The numeric code for TRTPGy. One-to-one mapping within a study to TRTPGy.
TRTAGy,Actual Pooled Treatment y,Char,,Cond,"TRTAGy is the actual pooled treatment y attributed to a record for analysis purposes. “y” represents an integer [1-99, not zero-padded] corresponding to a particular pooling scheme. Required when TRTPGy is present and TRTA is present."
TRTAGyN,Actual Pooled Treatment y (N),Num,,Perm,The numeric code for TRTAGy. One-to-one mapping within a study to TRTAGy.
