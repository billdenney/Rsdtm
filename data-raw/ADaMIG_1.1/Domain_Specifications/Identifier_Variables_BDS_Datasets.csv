ASEQ,Analysis Sequence Number,Num,,Perm,"Sequence number given to ensure uniqueness of subject records within an ADaM dataset. As long as values are unique within a subject within the dataset, any valid number can be used for ASEQ. ASEQ uniquely indexes records within a subject within an ADaM dataset.
ASEQ is useful for traceability when the dataset is used as input to another ADaM dataset. To refer
to a record in a predecessor ADaM dataset, set SRCDOM to the name of the predecessor dataset, and set SRCSEQ to the value of ASEQ in the predecessor dataset."
