Treatment",Char,,Perm,"If a subject discontinued treatment in the study, then this variable indicates the reason for discontinuation. This is for discontinuation of treatment in the overall study and not to be used for
discontinuation reason within individual treatment periods."

Treatment",Char,,Perm,"Additional detail regarding subject’s discontinuation from treatment (e.g., description of “other”)."

Consent",Num,,Perm,Date subject gave informed consent. Generally equivalent to DM.RFICDTC.
ENRLDT,Date of Enrollment,Num,,Perm,Date of subject’s enrollment into trial.
RANDDT,"Date of
Randomization",Num,,Cond,Required in randomized trials.
RFICyDT,Date of Informed Consent y,Num,,Perm,"This variable may be used in the case where there are multiple consent dates within a study. This date does not need to repeat the date in RFICDT. ‘y’ can start with 1 but it is not required to start
with 1."
ENRLyDT,Date of Enrollment y,Num,,Perm,"This variable may be used in the case where there are multiple enrollment dates within a study. This date does not need to repeat the date in ENRLDT. ‘y’ can start with 1 but it is not required to
start with 1."
RANDyDT,Date of Randomization y,Num,,Perm,"This variable may be used in the case where there are multiple randomization dates within a study. This date does not need to repeat the date in RANDDT. ‘y’ can start with 1 but it is not required to
start with 1."
LSTALVDT,Date Last Known Alive,Num,,Perm,"If this variable is included in ADSL, the best practice is to populate it for everyone. If the derivation for subjects who died differs from the derivation for subjects who are not known to have died, the differences should be noted in metadata."
TRCMP,Treatment Compliance (%),Num,,Perm,Overall percent compliance with treatment in the trial. TRCMP may be useful for inclusion in ADSL for reasons such as defining subgroups and/or populations.
TRCMPGy,"Treatment Compliance (%)
Group y",Char,,Perm,"Grouping ‘y’ of TRCMP, treatment compliance percentage."
TRCMPGyN,"Treatment Compliance (%)
Group y (N)",Num,,Perm,Numeric version of treatment compliance (%) grouping ‘y’. Must have a one-to-one mapping to TRCMPGy.
TRxxDURD,Treatment Duration in Period xx (Days),Num,,Perm,"Treatment duration for period xx as measured in days. More than one of TRxxDURD, TRxxDURM, and TRxxDURY can be populated, but each represents the entire duration in its
respective units."
TRxxDURM,"Treatment Duration in Period xx
(Months)",Num,,Perm,"Treatment duration for period xx, as measure in months. More than one of TRxxDURD, TRxxDURM, and TRxxDURY can be populated, but each represents the entire duration in its
respective units."
TRxxDURY,Treatment Duration in Period xx (Years),Num,,Perm,"Treatment duration for period xx, as measured in years. More than one of TRxxDURD, TRxxDURM, and TRxxDURY can be populated, but each represents the entire duration in its
respective units."
