Flag",Char,(TIMEFL),Cond,The level of imputation of AENTM based on the source SDTM DTC variable.  See General Timing Variable Convention #7.
AVISIT,Analysis Visit,Char,,Cond,"AVISIT may contain the visit names as observe d (i.e., from SDTM VISIT), derived visit names, time window names, conceptual descriptions (such as Average, Endpoint, etc.), or a combination of any of these.  AVISIT is a derived field and does not have to map to VISIT from the SDTM.  AVISIT represents the analysis visit of the record, but it does not mean that the record was analyzed.  There are often multiple records for the same subject and parameter that have the same value of AVISIT.  ANLzzFL and other variables may  be needed to identify the records selected for any given analysis.  See Section 3.2.6 for metadata about flag variables.  AVISIT should be unique for a given analysis visit window.  In the event that a record does not fall within any predefined analysis timepoint window, AVISIT can be populated in any way that the sponsor chooses to indicate this fact (i.e., blank or “Not Windowed”).  The way that AVISIT is calculated, including the variables used in its derivation, should be indicated in the variable metadata for AVISIT. The values and the rules for deriving AVISIT may be different for different parameters
within the same dataset.  Values of AVISIT are sponsor-defined, and are often directly usable in Clinical Study Report displays."
AVISITN,Analysis Visit (N),Num,,Perm,"A numeric representation of AVISIT.  This may be a protocol visit number, a week or cycle number, an analysis visit number, or any other number logically related to AVISIT or useful for sorting that is needed for analysis.  Within a parameter, there is a one-to-one mapping between AVISITN and AVISIT so that AVISITN has the same value for each distinct AVISIT.  In the event that a record does not fall within any predefined analysis
timepoint window, AVISITN can be populated in any way that the sponsor chooses to indicate this fact (e.g., may be null).  Values of AVISITN are sponsor-defined."
ATPT,Analysis Timepoint,Char,,Perm,"The analysis time point description which is required if analysis times are derived. Timepoints are relative to ATPTREF.
ATPT can be within an analysis visit (e.g., blood pressure assessments at 10 min, 20 min, and 30 min post-dose at AVISIT=Week 1) or can be unrelated to AVISIT (e.g., migraine symptoms 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min post-dose for attack 1)."
ATPTN,"Analysis
Timepoint (N)",Num,,Perm,"ATPTN provides a numeric representation of ATPT.  Within the same parameter, there is
a one-to-one mapping between ATPT and ATPTN."
ATPTREF,"Analysis Timepoint
Reference",Char,,Perm,Description of the fixed reference point referred to by ATPT/ATPTN.
APERIOD,Period,Num,,Perm,"The numeric value characterizing the period to which the record belongs.  The value of APERIOD must be consistent with the xx value in TRTxxP, TRTxxA, and all variables
whose names begin with TRxx and APxx."
APERIODC,Period (C),Char,,Perm,Text characterizing to which period the record belongs.  One-to-one map to APERIOD.
APHASE,Phase,Char,,Perm,"Generally, a higher-level categorization of APERIOD.  Does not replace APERIOD,
because APERIOD provides the indexing for the TRxx and APxx variables."
ARELTM,Analysis Relative Time,Num,,Perm,"The time relative to an anchor time.  When ARELTM is present, the anchor time variable
and ARELTMU must also be included in the dataset, and the anchor time variable must be identified in the metadata for ARELTM."
ARELTMU,"Analysis Relative
Time Unit",Char,,Cond,"The units of ARELTM.  For example, “HOURS” or “MINUTES.”  ARELTMU is
required if ARELTM is present."
APERSDT,Period Start Date,Num,,Perm,The starting date for the period defined by APERIOD.
APERSTM,Period Start Time,Num,,Perm,The starting time for the period defined by APERIOD.
