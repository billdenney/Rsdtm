--TERM,Reported Term*,Char,,Req,"XX.--TERM
This would be copied from the SDTM domain XX."
--DECOD,Dictionary- Derived Term,Char,MedDRA,Cond,"XX.--DECOD
This would be copied from the SDTM domain XX. It is typically one of the primary variables used in an analysis and would be brought in from the SDTM domain. Equivalent to the Preferred Term (PT in MedDRA). As mentioned above, all other SDTM domain variables and supplemental qualifiers needed for analysis or traceability should also be included. Include the dictionary version in the metadata.

--BODSYS,Body System or Organ Class,Char,MedDRA,Cond,"XX.--BODSYS
This would be copied from the SDTM domain XX. It is typically one of the primary variables used in an analysis and would be brought in from the SDTM domain. As mentioned above, all other SDTM domain variables and supplemental qualifiers needed for analysis or traceability should also be included. Include the dictionary version in the metadata.
